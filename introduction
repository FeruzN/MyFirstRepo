Brief Introduction About Myself

Hello! 
My name is Feruz. I am currently diving into the world of coding and learning how to use GitHub as part of my coursework and personal growth journey. 
I’ve always been curious about how technology shapes the modern world, and I’m excited to build new skills that will allow me to contribute to innovative solutions.
I hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil Engineering and also have a background in Nursing. 
These diverse academic paths have helped me develop strong problem-solving skills, adaptability, and a deep appreciation for both technical and human-centered fields. 
Although my academic journey began in engineering and healthcare, I have recently developed a passion for technology and programming.
My goal is to become a successful entrepreneur and eventually launch my own business. 
I believe that by combining my technical background, coding knowledge, and creative thinking, I can create impactful solutions that make a real difference. 
Learning GitHub is an important step in that journey, and I’m enthusiastic about growing my skills and collaborating with others in the tech community.
